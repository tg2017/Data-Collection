This program was designed to be used to collect data
for a single project. My 2016-17 science research project
was expected to have a large amount of data that would
need to be sorted and stored in a visually pleasing 
manner. I designed this program to help complete this
task quickly and efficiently, without the need to write
the data by hand. The idea of the project is to evaluate 
the ability of artificial intelligence programs to answer 
questions, and compare the benefits of using certain 
question structures over others based upon the accuracy 
of the computer's response.

*** Notes/Troubleshooting ***
*****************************

To ensure that everything within the program runs smoothly,
DO NOT MOVE any files out of the folder in which the .java
file is stored. The program relies on these files to store
and read data, and changing their location could cause 
problems when running it. If you have already moved a file 
from its original location and can move it back, do so to
prevent any issues related to a missing file.


Trouble with running the program:

This program runs primarily using Java. If you are having 
difficulties with running the program and have already 
attempted to open it several times, ensure that the latest
version of Java is installed on your computer and try again.


Trouble within the program:

Many times, if the program encounters an internal problem, 
an error message will appear to help identify the issue and
provide advice on how to avoid it in the future. However, if 
an unidentified error occurs and cannot be fixed, try restarting 
the program and trying again. Ensure that Java is installed properly
on your machine and that all required files are present in the 
program folder. If the problem still persists, contact me and I
will do my best to help resolve the issue (see below).
